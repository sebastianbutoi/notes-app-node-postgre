# notes-app

This is an app that I developed after the fifth week of the School of Code bootcamp. The front-end has been developed with **Bootstrap** and **vanilla js**. This was also my first time exploring and using Bootstrap.

The front-end makes requests to an API and updates the structure through the DOM manipulation. The API handles all the **CRUD** operations and it has been developed with **Node.js** and **Express**. The API is also connected to a **PostgreSQL** database, hosted on **Heroku**.

The project includes environment variables and an .env example file is provided.


## How the app looks like
